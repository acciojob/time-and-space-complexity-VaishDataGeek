	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>


  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, which means it can solve problems faster even with large inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. For example, an algorithm that stores an array of size n has a space complexity of O(n). It is important to analyze <b>Space Complexity</b> to ensure that the algorithm is memory-efficient and suitable for the given constraints.
